A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/JFarrow/pen/qobxRg.

 Recently I had to work on making a mega dropdown responsive while still offering all of the functionality. Users have to be able to click on top-level links and drill down to the categories. This is similar to what I ended up going with.

Inspired by the codyhouse mega dropdown.
